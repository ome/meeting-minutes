(2-3 minutes each)

    -   Mark: Progressing with omero-downloader work tracked on Data Out
        > board.

        > annotations. And Janelia dataset annotations, Ready to go.

    -   David: Testing hopefully final KLB changes for a while (Kate’s
        > data). Also testing some of Melissa’s PRs.

    -   Chris / G.S.: Customer stuff: file format changes. More PRs
        > inbound for David. Pretty close to being done. SEM discussions
        > ongoing: format and modelling. Datasets &gt;1TB/each (per
        > run). n\*10K files on disk. 6-10m fileset entries in DB. Would
        > like more examples, and potential preprocessing for
        > Bio-Formats before .bfmemo files, using that as primary store.

        -   Kevin going to feed back to OMERO and OMERO.web soon too.
            > PRs incoming.

    -   Simon: S3 work. Did import a .jpg over S3 into a custom OMERO,
        > but no metadata. Abstractions different compared to reading
        > code. Unit tests being worked out too. Have to have a big
        > discussion about Bio-Formats and file reading. Ad Hoc just
        > now.

        -   Melissa: what are you doing specifically, and what’s going
            > wrong?

        -   Simon: No, just have a few notes across a few PRs. Would
            > like to run full repo test, with some kind of shim
            > simulating remote-ness, to work on assumptions about
            > what’s local vs remote. Plan is more POC work then will be
            > written up in bugs/tickets/etc.

    -   Kenny:

        -   SSL certificates now deployed via Ansible
            > ([<u>prod-playbooks/legacy</u>](https://github.com/ome/prod-playbooks/tree/master))
            > making significant changes to config (via MT) across mosts
            > systems. Will make subsequent renewals much easier.

        -   Chris: tmp directory, check for number of sessions, clear
            > them out at a first pass. Suggest switch to redis, no
            > reason to keep using file-based sessions.

        -   Simon: Isolate a Web call, make the equivalent OMERO API
            > call?
