## AOB

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people and rescheduled)

## Main Topic

(20-25 minutes plus 15 minutes questions max)
- OMERO.figure & NGFF (Will) [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AAf3M5QcbjkZsp1QZZW3oW7EtSbwJGQ7ZxtnArnhSO0/edit#slide=id.p)
- JRS: 1. Let's consider decisions on updates not on number of changes of code but longer term maintenance. Effectively maintaining our own custom viewer in .figure seems not a great long-term plan.  
- 2. Would the use of coordinateTransforms cause conflicts, e.g. with CLEM data?  Maybe a na√Øve question. 
- 3. The full detach from OMERO server maybe worth considering, but would a user ever want to use OMERO as the metadata  source for a .figure workflow?  I think we discussed this in the context of direct support for NGFF data in .figure.  This is different than discussed-- is OK, just clarifying and trying to decide what we want to do first.
- 4. Scale bars.... are really important for a figure.
