    - NA

- NGFF
  - Java fun: bftools and update sites (Josh)
      - Workshop prep - OME-Zarr support not easy in standalone Bio-Formats.
      - Also https://forum.image.sc/t/getting-started-with-ome-zarr-in-java/85333/3 blosc, QPath etc.
      - Documentation could be improved
      - blosc not available on maven, needs env variable
      - Needs to be usable by regular users, not just devs
      - Josh: created tickets
      - Do we ship s3 support? (currently stripped out)
          - old libs and didn't work with OMERO
      - Seb: auth etc on s3 is hard - restrict scope

      - API for H&E models, including HoverNet segmentation: https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox
