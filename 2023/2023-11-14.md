## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://hackmd.io/team/ome?nav=overview)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR
  - Frances: public EBI folder now unblocked. Transfer in progress
  - Will: Seb ran memo file generation on idr-testing last week. Found a bunch of failures, mostly due to a missed sql statements (now fixed) but also 8 NGFF plates that are missing files on EBI s3. Re-running the conversion for these now... Also memo file generation is re-running due to memo cache not working on readonly-X proxy servers.
  - Decided to push NGFF release to early next year


- OMERO
  - issue with omero-py building on Windows see [std: binary function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1348183/std-binary-function-is-missing-in-msvc-14-37-32822) - don't block release, create an issue to keep track
