Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://hackmd.io/team/ome?nav=overview)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR
    - NGFF (Will) - mkngff sql scripts in github, [applied to all filesets on idr-testing](https://github.com/IDR/idr-metadata/issues/675): see https://idr-testing.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/usertags/?show=tag-38280641. Memo file generated for first fileset from each study.
    - Now I've [updated mkngff](https://github.com/IDR/omero-mkngff/pull/12) and the [sql scripts](https://github.com/IDR/idr-utils/pull/56#issuecomment-1765313452) to set `clientpath` for every file to the corresponding s3 URL
    - ZarrReader https://github.com/ome/ZarrReader/pull/64 Performace improvements works with mkngff but breaks import.
    - TODO (for release): PR merge (idr-utils, ZarrReader), testing (e.g. performance), validation, memo file regeneration
    - TODO (post release) cleanup/delete from s3 etc, documentation
    - Q: what is the future workflow for NGFF data? Use `mkngff` (not working for idr0125) OR import metadata-only (without chunks, then symlink)
    - ZarrReader: need to figure out what changes needed to enable import AND Performance improvements.

- OMERO
    - Andreas: omero-web release in due course, couple of questions for Will
    - Petr & Khaled: RHEL9 testing of deployment. Server and web (with nginx) deployed 3 times. Running fine.
        - SELinux issues with services
        - Seb: production system soon (end of year)? Petr yes
        - Seb: GPFS is next big "beast"

- Bio-Formats (David)
    - 7.0.1 patch release yesterday. Announcements today.
