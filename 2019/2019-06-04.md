        -   Josh: working to get
            > [<u>idr-ci</u>](https://idr-ci.openmicroscopy.org/jenkins/job/Trigger)

        -   Simon: close to getting Bio-Formats backported to the
            > mainline?

            -   Seb: probably requires multiple weeks, few months of

        -   Last week's testing uncovered a serious problem in
            > OMERO.server 5.5 with missing search results.
            > Investigating but no promising leads yet. Intermittently,
            > indexing omits some terms but with no difference even in
            > Hibernate Search TRACE-level logs. Likelihood appears very
            > system-dependent which is why this had been missed.
            > (Indexing works fine on merge-ci but on eel it has
            > difficulty with image names.)

            -   Jason: timescales.

        -   Josh: Sanger (Ola) looking to get involved into development.

            > next to-do so that external developers can contribute.

    -   Hoping to shut down forum threads. Final calls to close open
