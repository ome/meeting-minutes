        -   Last week's testing uncovered a serious problem in

            > Investigating but no promising leads yet. Intermittently,
            > indexing omits some terms but with no difference even in
            > Hibernate Search TRACE-level logs. Likelihood appears very
            > system-dependent which is why this had been missed.
            > (Indexing works fine on merge-ci but on eel it has
            > difficulty with image names.)
