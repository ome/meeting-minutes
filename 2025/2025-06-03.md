Will: see [idr0125 in BFF](https://bff.allencell.org/app?c=File+Path%3A0.25%2CPlate%3A0.25%2CWell%3A0.25%2CWell+Number%3A0.25&source=%7B%22name%22%3A%22idr0125-screenA-annotation_bff.csv+%2803%2F06%2F2025+11%3A40%3A55%29%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22csv%22%2C%22uri%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIDR%2Fidr0125-way-cellpainting%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fscripts%2Fidr0125-screenA-annotation_bff.csv%22%7D) from [csv_to_biofilefinder.py](https://github.com/IDR/idr0125-way-cellpainting/blob/main/scripts/csv_to_biofilefinder.py).
