    - Upcoming work on lossy compression in Zarr. Will raise the chunking/dimension order issue
    - Josh: hoping to be able and drop the dimension order over the summer 
    - Seb: any suspicion we might come back to the Samples dimension problem (cf recent aicsimageio discussions)
    - Chris: people can extend their modality. Certainly losing some metadata at the moment. Harder for the client which has to guess
    - Josh: multiple napari threads. Each layer == 1 color map. Want to attach metadata. Introducing some form of object model. Similar question for Zarr i.e. introduce some layer concept?
    - Similar problems with original file formats e.g. YCbCr etc
  - Moving towards releases of bioformat2raw/raw2ometiff/isyntax2raw
