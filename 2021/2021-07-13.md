    - contributions from external need CLA to be signed
    - easy to forget. Needs automation. e.g. github action
    - Organisation-wide GHA would be handy
  - preparing iviewer release ahead of next IDR prod

- Glencoe

  - Codec will have associated caveats
  - Tricky to configure compression params with JPEG2000 and JPEG-LS
    - Upcoming DICOM work. Spec is complex
