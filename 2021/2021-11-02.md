### NGFF update

 - OME roadmap/OKR
   - Seb: original goals in September. Full export of collections + rendering +K/V as OME-Zarr and reimport
   - Too ambitious?
 - Axes spec. [PR #57](https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/57) and [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/t/request-for-comments-for-ome-ngff-v0-4-axes-and-transformation-metadata/59298/2) Should spec say SHOULD be zyx? Waiting on implementations:
   - omero-cli-zarr
   - ome-zarr-py: scales in 2D: zyx
   - vizarr: axis *names* OK, but not transformations, only handle zyx (not xyz)
   - napari-ome-zarr: 

 - Validation [Salad schema PR](https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/69)
   - Some MUST rules can't be validated by Salad - (see PR)
   - Classes are "guessed" based on field names - Not JSON-LD class "type"
   - Fails if a MUST rule is not met, but SHOULD rules not handled
   - How to handle versioning?
   - Don't know how to split files up
   - How to allow ANY key-value pairs?
   - No decsion yet on whether to proceed with SALAD or if a different approach is needed.
   - Various features / use-cases we want from validation, not *just* JSON checking. E.g. linking, search, RDF (JSON-LD features)
   - Not enough time to cover everything in today's meeting. Need another meeting - next week?
 - Public v0.3 data
   - Where to do conversion and hosting?
