# 2021-08-24

Attending: Jean-Marie, Seb, Frances, Will, Khaled, Dom, Petr, June, Chris, David, Josh, Wilma, Muhanad, Melissa, Erin, Kevin, Jason, 

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://github.com/ome/meeting-minutes)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR
  - Customization (Chris): any time spent thinking about how to modify the look&feel. Not really.
      - Jason: been wondering when/if to mention.
  - Frances: prod100 - 3 new studies due to release next week. One EBI embassy cloud

- NGFF
  - Will: https://github.com/will-moore/omero-web-zarr
    - Similar to omero-ms-zarr but as web app. Follows standard auth.
    - Useful with imjoy (https://github.com/will-moore/omero-imjoy)
    - Allows web to provide more pixel data. Potentially for QuPath?
    - Thoughts on supporting it versus omero-ms-zarr?
    - Seb: support both? Currently do both for thumbnails, rendering.
      - Perhaps depends on the use case
    - J-m: candidate for testing against other repositories
    - Deployed? It's on merge-ci. Right click has open-with vizarr.
      - Just not a merge build of open PRs.
    - JRS: for ourselves & linking to other projects, potential strong argument.
    - Josh: currently only solution to have Zarr via OMERO in a non-public context.
    - Chris: danger of adding another component to our stack esp. with OMERO.web not designed to perform these serial changes.
      - Josh: worse than Python thumbnailing strategy? Chris: not worse but another instance
      - omero-ms-zarr vs omero-web-zarr, Python vs Java. Cost of implementing something the right way.
    - Might need a URL review
    - Move this conversation into an issue
  - v0.3
    - NB: PR for [v0.3 support](https://github.com/will-moore/omero-web-zarr) awaiting v0.3 release (Will)
    - Josh: spec v0.3 looking good. Will move ahead...
  - Josh: Zarr v2.9.x saga
    - will keep releasing 2.9.x
    - zarr / n5 compatibility not there yet
    - fixing issues without breaking existing usage
  - Jason: Paper resubmitted to Nature Methods as Brief Comm
    - switched from commentary to brief comm
    - shorter, hopefully more impact & focussed
    - more background discussion/info moved to Supplemental Material

- Releases
  - BF 6.7.0 yesterday
    - tweeted for 1st time in 5 months; +ve feedback
  - to come: omero-py with download fix

- Glencoe:
  - Looking at UI customization of omero-web
    - e.g. login page, icons etc.
    - reviewing older config options vv more recent Django
  - single sign-on
  - legacy archive flags on images
  - alternative locations for data. e.g. zarr on s3 buckets
  - bio-formats work in progress

- Community
    - [SBI2](https://sbi2.org/events/) - suggested participation
      - Jason: high profile HCS meeting, includes pharma
      - expect interest in data management
      - e.g. ngff, multi-well demo (HCS metadata in zarr spec)
      - registration is cheap - virtual meeting

## AOB

- OSARS and OKRs  (JRS)
  - start in September
  - OKR process not annual. e.g 3 months
  - "What do we need to do?"
    - exposure to community: forum, IDR etc
    - need to balance with team goals
    - Objectives and Key goals - measurable
    - OK (expected) not to achieve all goals
  - Frances: replace OSARs?
    - JRS: evolve OSARs, yes. Update form etc.
  - Seb: ngff paper submitted; what next? (more metadata!)
    - Use key idr studies as a driver
    - e.g. HPA (start with subset?) -> metadata-complete OME-NGFF. Query IDR for this data
    - key-value pairs? fixing search. What clients can work with this data?
