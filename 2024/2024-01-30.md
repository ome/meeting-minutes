    - Will: adapting [check_pixels.py](https://github.com/IDR/idr-utils/pull/55#issuecomment-1915051356) script, running in parallel to try and reproduce issues we've seen from web. getPlane() doesn't cause issues but renderImage() does. Need to look into stack traces.

## AOB

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people and rescheduled)

## Main Topic

(20-25 minutes plus 15 minutes questions max)

 - Erin: Tissue clearing workshop last week - 100 attendees.
 - Presented our Webknosses work
 - Users typically use desktop apps - remote Desktop etc
 - Advantages of web browser access
 - Most viewers aren't 3D
 - Users are familiar with Webknosses
 - Webknosses: orthogonal views and volume view
 - OMERO.script tells Webknosses where the s3 NGFF data is and gets a URL to open Webknosses.
 - Webknosses server provides auth etc to access s3 but web viewer does consume zarr data.
 - 3D chunk data 32 x 32 x 32 doesn't open in PathViewer
 - OMERO.script is very fast & light - could be done with Open-with plugin instead of a script?
