## AOB

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people and rescheduled)

## Main Topic

Technical discussion focusing on [Java version 17 suupport in OMERO.server](https://github.com/ome/openmicroscopy/issues/6383)
 - Feedback on process welcome
 - Java programming language - LTS releases
 - Core OME repos in Java. Require Java 8+, Some Java 11
 - Users need JRE to run apps
 - Devs need JDK - OpenJDK released 2007 by Sun Microsystems
 - Now multiple JDK distributions
 - JDK builds only get support for 6 months
 - Other vendors ship their own OpenJKD releases with different EOL
     - e.g. RedHat JDK 11 EOL Oct 2024
 - Bio-Formats 6.12.0 added support for Java 17
     - recently added support for Java 21
 - OMERO server doesn't yet support Java 17 - reflection issue
     - Strongly encapsulated - can't access protected/private Java API methods
     - workaround: use --add-opens to JVM
     - also need --add-exports to avoid IllegalAccessError
     - This allows us to run OMERO.server on Java 17
     - These options not supported for Java 8.
 - Next steps:
     - review dependencies etc to remove need for reflection
