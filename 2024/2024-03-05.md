 - Now have finance to implement this
 - Ease of use, FAIRness etc
 - Encourage core facility staff to use OMERO for their own data
 - Benefits of training etc

     - microscope-metrics: algorithms
     - schema: Link-ml
     - microscope-metrics-omero: Interface with OMEREO
 - Seb: who will want to access the data? Users?
     - Julio: yes. Publish QC data alongside experimental data
