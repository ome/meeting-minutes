    - Frances: software release (svs idr0043 fix and Microservices deployment).
    - Deploy on idr-testing today and team testing tomorrow. If OK, then update production server directly.

    - Not tested plate conversions yet (Dom looking at that).

- OMERO:
    - Seb: upcoming server release to address old log4j jar included in the build (unintented artifact of the build system). image.sc post describes how to remove extra jars. No security risk AFA we can tell.

        - Don't hold up IDR release. Can remove extra jars manually
