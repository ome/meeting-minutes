## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR (Frances):
    - Khaled tested CentOS 7 with Postgres 13 against Rocky9 with Postgres 16: indexing time similar.
    - Decided not to investigate why we saw slower Postgres 13 on Rocky Linux. Maybe due to Rocky9 needing more resources than CentOS 7 (therefore slower on same hardware)

    - Jason: please tweet, linked-in etc about new release
