Attending: Will, Dom, Jason, JM, Petr, Maadhav, Frances, Seb, Khaled, Kyle, Melissa, David S, Chris, Erin, 

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://hackmd.io/team/ome?nav=overview)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR Frances: working on study idr0158, human lymph node sections. Lots of antibodies, e.g 30-40 per image. Submitter used antibody kits. One ID (links to kit) includes several names/targets. Need to update antibody annotations: Name and Identifier (similar to Genes). Will affect search and gallery. Previously, antibody search was by ID. Needs to include search by target name.
    - NGFF challenge: idr0157, idr0090, idr0044 done, and some others ongoing... See NGFF below.

- OMERO
    - systems have been down. Back to normal now.

- Bio-Formats - Melissa: ome model issues reviewed, See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twj5KHNZsOSkvDYqTtGdegor8IIwvcD2xOTa376i7Uc/edit. Schema update TBD. Feedback on the doc.
    - Seb: imaris response in prep

- NGFF
    - Will: ngff-challenge, focussing on [viewing results](https://samples-viewer--ome2024-ngff-challenge.netlify.app/?csv=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will-moore/ome2024-ngff-challenge/samples_viewer/samples/ngff_samples.csv). Feedback welcome, e.g. [on the PR](https://github.com/ome/ome2024-ngff-challenge/pull/50).
    - Jason: link to ngff-challenge data from IDR

- GerBI

- Glencoe
    - Chris: OMERO.tables API investigation wrt using other storage solutions in place of py-tables. Seb: API is poorly documented. Works for omero-web usage, but other edge-cases and uses are possible via API. Can get unexpected results. 
    - Erin: blog post in progress with content presented at recent meeting SBI2.  https://www.glencoesoftware.com/blog/2024/09/18/complex-workflows.html 

- Community
    - OME systems update (hardware issue on Saturday): JM: all systems are back up.
        - Migration will continue once a faulty component is replaced (unrelated)
    - Wellcome Funding update. -> May 2029. File formats and IDR. Maturing OME-NGFF spec, including metadata. Multi-modal and correlative imaging - modelling and viz. See proposal in docs.
        - [Original Wellcome Call](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/bioimaging-technology-development-awards)
