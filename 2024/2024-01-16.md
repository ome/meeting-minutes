## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://hackmd.io/team/ome?nav=overview)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR:
    - Next release: idr0138 (NGFF) and idr0154
        - idr0138 imported over holidays, ROIs now created - rendering settings needed
        - idr0154 import will be quick
    - NGFF release: "stress testing" this morning. Some images felt like they are loading a bit slower than on IDR, but difficult to quantify. Performance seemed to improve with more browsing (caching??).
        - idr0011 Plate failing, due to renaming/moving on BIA s3.
        - Various other plates resubmitted to BIA are now available (we have hosted these on our custom s3 buckets in the meantime for idr-next). Now looking at updating these to use BIA data...
        - Running mkngff again to update NGFF Fileset will add `_mkngff` to templatePrefix, e.g. `demo_2/2016-07/28/21-44-02.006_mkngff_mkngff`.
        - Some images didn't load, but appeared OK when re-loaded. 

- OMERO
  - upcoming release omero-py: 3.8 Python is the minimum version.
      - Fixes test-infra (Pillow version issue)
  
- Bio-Formats (David)
    - PR reviews -
        - Aim for 1st week of Feb for next 7.2.0 release (or 2 weeks later if date is missed)
    - Nico Quick czi reader progressing
    - ZarrReader moving towards NGFF v0.5 spec support
        - will keep changes up to date with spec changes

- NGFF
  - No word on transforms. Time limit/cutoff?
      - implementations progressing, python, JavaScript, etc
      - We should look at ome-ngff-validator (schemas now available)
  - [RFC](https://forum.image.sc/t/ngff-rfc-process-proposal-draft-now-available/90181) proposal opened. Next step: identifer reviewers.
    - Additionally [ZEP0](https://zarr.dev/zeps/active/ZEP0000.html) is also undergoing review. Hopefully get this signed off by spring.
  - Starting [Office hours](https://forum.image.sc/t/ome-files-office-hours-wednesdays-at-alternative-times/90850) to restart the website meetings
    - Will: currently open issues? Josh: ping me URLs or we can meet at a different time?
    - Upcoming questions around implementations (e.g., ilastik) 

- Glencoe Chris
    - Django 5.0 released. More async features, some things deprecated. Requires python 3.10.
    - omero-web cleanup needed, old apis, interactions etc.
    - Seb: python 2 compatibility code cleanup, 'future' etc.
    - character encoding in NGFF, reserved chars, unicode etc. How to handle during conversion?

    - Users start KV workflow in webclient, but doesn't work for SPW Wells.
    - Single script to handle CSV -> P/D/I S/P/A/W and vice-versa (export KVP to csv)
    - Also need Delete KVP script
    - Namespace update "editable" vv protected from client editing
