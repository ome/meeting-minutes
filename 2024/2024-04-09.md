## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR (Frances):
    - quick NGFF test this morning of ZarrReader with s3 AND microservices. Looking good, best yet. More testing (multi Z/T images) and stress testing next.
    - David: ZarrReader updated to use s3 AWS SDK (v1 to match microservices) to access data directly.
    - Will: uses URL from bfoptions file, generated by omero-mkngff (PR open)
    - Seb: quite specific to IDR use-case: how to brand this etc? JM: similar to micro-services, not yet generally promoted for OMERO installs
    - David: several ZarrReader-specific options used by IDR, but could be made more generic
    - Jason: e.g. GigaScience has [Technical Note](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/technical_note) where this could be published.
