# 2022-05-31

Attending: Petr, Josh, Dom, Seb, Khaled, Frances, Jean-Marie, June, Andreas, Will, Davids Gault & Stirling, Jason, Kyle, Emil, Mina, Muhanad, Kevin

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://github.com/ome/meeting-minutes)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR
    - Will: new search on IDR front page: https://github.com/IDR/idr-gallery/pull/8 (deployed on idr-testing)
        - weblient search: https://github.com/ome/omero-web/pull/368 
        - https://github.com/ome/omero_search_engine_client/pull/18 
        - planning on exposing the search API and start consuming it internally as a first step
        - current status (linked above) allows searching without knowing the key you're looking for _a priori_
        - feedback (& testing!) welcome
        - also a version running on merge-ci which re-uses search_engine_client (since the lucene backend of IDR doesn't work)
        - good deal of pieces that need extracting / refactoring
        - gone next 3 days but have temporarily made webclient search not depend on search_engine_client django app, just copied into the webclient PR for now
    - tl;dr -- start here --> https://idr-testing.openmicroscopy.org
    
- Bio-Formats
    - 6.10.0 release out now - Slidebook7 reader. Tweets etc coming...
    - Seb: follow with server release

- OMERO
    - JM: Doc migrated to [readthedocs](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Work on redirecting docs.o.org to readthedocs as part of the next openmicroscopy release (floating point)
    - Seb: floating point: testing looks good. Configuration - defaults not changed.
        - Documentation to be updated
    - JM: ZarrReader bumped. Further testing needed? Discuss at standup tomorrow
    - work on metadata tables (MZ). Ramping up on testing, esp. sparse data in tables.

- NGFF
  - [Metadata work](https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/112) roadmap ok?

      - Will: tried to revive https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr/pull/125

      - Use this template for other public samples
  - FYI: https://ome.github.io/ome-ngff-validator/
