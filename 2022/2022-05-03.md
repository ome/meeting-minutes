## Project Status

- IDR:
    - Next release - 3 viruses and time-lapse study, and histology sections (5 studies).
    - Release on Thursday. But, embassy upgrade still ongoing… Assume OK for now.
    - 2 new videos for “showcase”. IDR analytical workflow on Analysis section on IDR front page
    - Search ongoing. Seb: next target is June incl. search

- OMERO (JM)
    - FYI: Working on alternative to replace the CI jobs
    - Doc to rtd.PR 2195 - priority since release is currently painful
        - Naming / urls on rtd
        - More flexible release of docs when e.g. omero-web / omero-py releases
    - Artifacts to GitHub PR 6318

- Bio-Formats (Bio-Formats)
    - ZarrReader testing etc
    - https://github.com/ome/ZarrReader/issues/32

- NGFF
    - image.name 
        - poorly named from ZarrReader. Could use OME.xml. Needs discussion.
        - https://github.com/ome/design/issues/57
    - OME-XML testing & v0.2-v0.4
    - bf2raw rcs? Maven rc? conda?
    - polygons & extensions to metadata
        - Polygons may clash with OME.xml
        - Seb: deprecating OME-XML’s mask? “Use labels”
        - J-m: going back to label itself. Loss of context.
    - Scifio metadata
    - dask writing - see PR
    - zarr 2.12 release soon (zarr v3), governance, etc.
    - J-m: Catalog & Showcases
        - How comfortable to start highlighting converted data?
        - E.g. on the website.Have notebooks, workshops, etc.

- Glencoe (Chris):
    - Using NGFF labels with OMERO & masks. ZarrReader support
    - Adding lots of annotations to ROIs, e.g. KVpairs, modifiable etc. Encode this in OME.xml or just NGFF? Andreas: push more logic to server
    - Extensions, labels min/max, histograms etc.
    - Plate metadata duplicated between OME.xml and NGFF. precedence?
    - Image names - OME.xml from s3 or Azure - poorly named images
    - Insight sessions issue

- Community
    - I2K coming soon. Some team attending
    - EBI course week on 16th May
