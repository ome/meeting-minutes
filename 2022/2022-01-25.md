        - learning curve but lots of progress
            - 0.4 spec (axes + HCS) implementations & samples
            - draft rendering specification
            - validation, schemas
    - Next steps
        - critical need for support OME-NGFF in OMERO
        - 4 or 5 datasets in IDR need this
        - Blockers (Josh):
          - capturing metadata from XML in Zarr
          - Could do "metadata lite/weak"
        - Glencoe solutions, use in IDR?
        - Jason: target is to make OME-NGFF as well-supported as OME-TIFF
        - Josh: OME-NGFF labels aren't supported in OMERO
        - Chris: Use OMERO-4-like strategy. OMERO knows about structure of data.
        - Josh - to miss this meeting next week, please record

- Glencoe
  - auth for s3
  - more to come

- Community
  - Global BioImaging workshops today/tomorrow
