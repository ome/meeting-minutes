# 2022-06-21

Attending: Will, Dom, Petr, Frances, Jean-Marie, Seb, Josh, Khaled, David, Kyle, Melissa, Kevin, Suzanne K, Chris, 

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://github.com/ome/meeting-minutes)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR
  - planning to release today but issues:
      - search indexing...
      - released Dataset: well annotations
  - Search
    - Josh feedback: facet search & cross-indexing
        - packages available for facet search. May need different indexing
        - Do we need study metadata on Images and vice versa? For grouping (like mapr "give me Projects which contain Images with matching Key/Value"). But explosion in index size.
        - Jason: No (not for IDR).  Start with "find me studies with these keywords"
        - Chris: ES not designed to do many-to-many joins with queries in both directions. Need to enforce e.g. Image in 1 Dataset
        - JM: can do this with IDR, but not so generic for other OMERO use-cases

- Bio-Formats
  - ZarrReader integration - dependency discrepancies between OMERO and BioFormats. Will look at this till Thursday. If no solution, will not include in next OMERO release

- OMERO
  - Build system investigation on-going.
      - Not working as expected with ZarrReader  

- NGFF
  - Neuroglancer: https://bit.ly/3MQtk7y ([code](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/tree/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/zarr))
  - Quarep & the metadata backdoor:
      - generate metadata (OME.xml) file and store alongside data
      - Jason: validation?
  - FFMPEG (other movie formats) -> OME-NGFF conversion
      - Chris: output will be much larger
  - John Bogovic will host next NGFF call (v0.5, transformations)

- Glencoe
  - Ongoing min/max calculation, NGFF work...
  - layout spec

- Community
  - SLS workshop
      - follow up meeting with user cf. analysis
      - Small numbers but very engaged users
  - ELMI feedback (Josh)
    - iRODS - well received
    - NGFF & VR (Warwick)
    - Protocols.io OMERO widget (omero-web app?)
    - MoBIE projects in OMERO (attach metadata to Project/Dataset)
    - https://twitter.com/MicroscopyDB training community
  - Suzanne: how to forward/delegate help requests to appropriate experts: i3D:bio or OME team?
      - Meeting to discuss?
      - many users reluctant to ask questions publicly (image.sc)
      - Jason: hard to move an established discussion into public, best to start in public. 
  - OME meeting (virtual) looking like week of 14th November
