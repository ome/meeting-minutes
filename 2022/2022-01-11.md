    - HPA run 11
    - idr0124 Heart morphogenesis

- NGFF:
  - collections, rendering, validation, axes, HCS, all in progress
  - NGFF call 27th Jan
  - NGFF workshop pushed back, probably to 6th April (was Feb 16th)

- Community
    - Maven Scijava - see https://forum.image.sc/t/scijava-maven-repository-down/61806 and https://forum.image.sc/t/stonehenge-glencoesoftware-com-hammering-maven-scijava-org/61474 
        - Chris: mirrors in place for all, can switch over.
        - Jason: any further discussion required?
        - Chris: probably. Mirroring all external repository and becoming the central repository for biological domain has some implications.
    - JM: Global bioimaging call Thursday - will keep team posted

## AOB

- Support ShapeColumn: likely not worth a server API change? 
    - Also some work from Muhanad re DatasetColumn but this was already existing server-side.
    - Discussion appeared within IDR team. Was found to be possibly a lot of work.
    - Erin: dealing with similar situations with column without an associated type. In this case, not even an OMERO model object.
    - JM: idr0113 also use-case for shape column
    - Will: also limited understanding of the supported scenario in metadata population plugin (e.g. Plate - or Screen - with ROI ID)
    - Emil: not using ROI/Shape too much at the moment. Use case for Shape in HCS domain?
    - Jason: keep an eye on impact of these changes

- Laptops
    - Two Univ Dundee M1s arrived and awaiting pickup.

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people and rescheduled)
