  - Heads up that the Zarr [Outreachy cohort](https://outreachy.org/) is particularly large.

- GerBI
  - Tom: TiM 2023 preparations
    - Acquifier already has a Hive with OMERO installed (on Linux VM)
    - In 2 weeks, testing of that should begin.
    - Also have a Hive available locally in DÃ¼sseldorf for testing. Can perhaps install a VM as well.
    - Petr: when & where would the database be accepted?
      - Tom: doing everything remotely for installation.
      - Could load it in two weeks as well. Zenodo ok? Yes. (60-70 GB)

- Glencoe
  - Chris: small number of changes (with potentially big impact)
    - in pursuit of server/web install on Ubuntu 22.04 (Python 3.10, OpenSSL 3)
    - conda & MacOS also have issues. esp. when OpenSSL bumps.
    - integrate omero-certificates with the main stack? (basically a requirement now)
    - some harder decisions to make moving forward. (docs & support)
  - Melissa: aware of spec changes coming but no action items yet
  - Seb: limitations of the Duplicate command.
    - esp. around ExternalInfo, since that's not used in the OSS version
    - most of the work is in the test coverage
  - Chris:
    - some of the importing classes need subclassability
    - can be wrapped into a single blitz release

 - Discussion on OME Community meeting
 - Petr: 1 hour consultation in Edinburgh tomorrow (mostly PIs)
