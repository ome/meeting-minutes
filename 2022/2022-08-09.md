# 2022-08-09

Attending: Jason, June, Will, Petr, Josh, Tom, Seb, Frances, Wilma, Andreas, Kyle, David G., Melissa, Emil, Mina, Muhanad, Erin, Kevin

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [last meeting](https://github.com/ome/meeting-minutes)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR (Frances):
    - lots of testing new datasets & formats.
    - next release: idr0134 plant study ontology mapping
    - Seb: storage space still an issue
        - investigating new storage, performance issues
        - several new submissions are in OME-NGFF format which may offer a solution in future - we don't host the data but "import" from remote
        - Jason: could move less critical datasets to free-up space
        - Josh: for more-frequently accessed data, cache will help performance

- OMERO:
    - OMERO.figure release soon (this week)

- Bio-Formats:
    - 6.10.1 patch release on Thursday

- NGFF (Josh)
  - FYI: ZEP2 (Sharding): https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft_zeps/
  - Java/Zarr chat (Aug. 2) summary
    - 5ish choices: jzarr, n5, netcdf-java, fork, new
        - next steps: code to show example questions
    - other levels of the same problem (codecs, s3-libraries, array libraries, "high-level" apis)
    - Seb: matrix of libs and maintainers, pros / cons?

- Glencoe:
    - "NGFF Converter" UI tool release coming.
        - All open-source. Builds will be signed etc. 
        - Seb: useful for IDR submitters too.
    - NGFF import performance investigations, good to compare OMERO and OMERO plus.

- GerBI:
    - Tom: UI tool for using neural-net with OMERO

- Community
    - Holidays and Support
    - image.sc etc: OK to say "lots of team away - we'll get back to you"
    - OME meeting - vision document nearly ready...
        - Virtual meeting
    - NIH virtual workshop in September to highlight importance of imaging data
    - Josh: Volume EM community interested in moving to OME-NGFF
