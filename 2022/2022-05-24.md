        - 2 studies (screens)
        - Release target: Week beginning 6th June

- OMERO
  - omero-py (Seb) https://github.com/ome/omero-py/milestone/6
  - Roadmap for OMERO.server with ZarrReader (Josh)
      - Are we ready? Thoughts?
      - Any requirement to release in next 2 weeks? No?
      - JM: do we wait for docs (see below)?
      - Seb: include floating-point safety fixes? Adds value for more users
          - Floating point fixes ready soon - end of week
      - JM: sooner release might mean we get OMERO.server out of sync with docs
      - Seb: vote for only supporting BioFormats metadata with v0.4 OME-NGFF.
          - reduces support matrix
          - Josh: PR for ZarrReader to NOT support v0.2 & v0.3?
          - Chris: recent HCS fixes in v0.4 - more robust/tested
  - Documentation: Migration plan
      - merge [2195](https://github.com/ome/omero-documentation/pull/2195)
      - deploy on RTD
      - 2 sets of doc (docs.o.org and rtd) so we can iron out possible issues with rtd. Then redirect docs.o.org to rtd: target next openmicroscopy release.
  
- NGFF (Josh)
  - NGFF Papers coming out: (Viv, Transcriptomics, MoBie,) & survey
  - NBOQ - building on OME metadata - how to expand

- Glencoe
    - Floating-point pyramids - discussed with OME team earlier
        - Fixes in progress
    - Insight install on Windows overwrites. Installer config not possible
        - Workaround is to uninstall and re-install Insight
    - Upgrade version checking
        - QA out of sync with versions. Always get "Your server is out of date"
        - Fixes in progress
        - Seb: shouldn't claim we have upgrade infrastructure - confusing to users
