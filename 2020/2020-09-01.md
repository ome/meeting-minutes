4. Main Topic
-------------

(20-25 minutes plus 15 minutes questions max)

Usage Stats: upgrade checks - total vv unique IPs

Zarr fun if desired

\- All PRs in ‘sets of 3’ omero-ms-zarr (spec), ome-zarr-py &
omero-cli-zarr,

\- ome-zarr-py \#45 lots of changes. Black formatting etc. pre-commit
file.

\- mypi - specify return types. Work to add, but useful for refactoring

\- conda environment.yml - not many versions pinned yet. Might be
needed.

\- testing qt via github actions is hard. OS-specific.

\- ome-zarr create - to create sample data. Avoid hitting s3 in testing

\- Main change: graph traversal API. entry point: parse\_url()

\- also split out napari logic.

\- separate our metadata from napari spec. E.g. ‘contrast\_limits’

\- Chris: we’ve had issues with graph traversal on s3 - xarray any use?

> \- Josh: that’s using fsspec. Could support /add that in our api

\- Layer (from napari) hard to know what’s in the tuples.

> \- need to add labels ‘on top’ - layer opacity allows other layers
> below

\- Other types possible - e.g. image-image links.

\- Need a name for hierarchy of data ‘layers’ with metadata

\- Hierarchy is converted into ordered list of layers, retaining the
relationships between them.

\- Reader class - uses ‘yeild’ generators everywhere, but not used
anywhere yet - napari wants everything up front.

\- Scaler class - used for downsampling. Used by omero-cli-zarr so that
it saves downsampled labels.

\- Can now download any image with labels (both as pyramids) and open in
napari.

\- naming needs deciding on: e.g. labels layers are identified by
‘color’ metadata.

Expect more discussions in public when released.
