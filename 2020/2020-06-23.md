    -   Idr0071 needs more testing: Simon:

            > [<u>https://github.com/ome/omero-blitz/issues/91</u>](https://github.com/ome/omero-blitz/issues/91)

        -   32 images have excess metadata: Potential workaround

        -   Duplicate Project/Dataset names causing issues

        -   Plan to import then assess

        -   Frances: plan was for prod84 (with idr0079, idr0077,
            > idr0070)

        -   Could release prod84 with those. Need to contact idr0071

            -   Spatially indexed representation of polygons to overlay
                > on images

            -   Done via a column store-like representation which could

            -   … &gt; Pathology … &gt; … &gt; DICOM …

        -   But: Was unclear on tile server feature. Upcoming
